# Entity Resolution
Let us first consider what an entity is. Much as the key step in machine learning is to determine what an instance is, the key step in entity resolution is to determine what an entity is. Letâ€™s define an entity as a unique thing (a person, a business, a product) with a set of attributes that describe it (a name, an address, a shape, a title, a price, etc.). That single entity may have multiple references across data sources, such as a person with two different email addresses, a company with two different phone numbers, or a product listed on two different websites. If we want to ask questions about all the unique people, or businesses, or products in a dataset, we must find a method for producing an annotated version of that dataset that contains unique entities.
